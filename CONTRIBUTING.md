# Contributing to VirtOS

Thank you for your interest in contributing to VirtOS! We are building a community dedicated to digital sovereignty and privacy. Every contribution, from a small typo fix to a new feature module, is welcome.

## How to Contribute

We use GitHub to manage all contributions. The general workflow is as follows:

1.  **Find an Issue:** Look for an existing issue in our [GitHub Issues](link-to-issues-page) tab. We use the label `good first issue` for tasks that are great for new contributors.
2.  **Create an Issue:** If you have a new idea, a feature request, or have found a bug, please create a new issue first to discuss it with the team.
3.  **Fork the Repository:** Create your own copy of the VirtOS repository to work on.
4.  **Create a Branch:** Create a new branch in your fork for your changes.
5.  **Write Code & Tests:** Make your changes and ensure you add any necessary tests.
6.  **Submit a Pull Request:** Once your work is ready, submit a Pull Request (PR) to the main VirtOS repository. [span_0](start_span)Please provide a clear description of the changes you have made[span_0](end_span).
