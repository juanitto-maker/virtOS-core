## üëÅÔ∏è Vision

In a world of constant surveillance and cloud-dependency, VirtOS is a declaration of digital independence. It is a modular, privacy-first virtual operating environment designed to protect your most valuable asset: your ideas. Born from the experience of navigating a hostile digital world, VirtOS provides a secure, self-contained workspace that runs entirely on your device, shielded from external threats and corporate data harvesting. You don't sign up; you don't upload your life to the cloud. You run your own AI system, in your own space, with your own rules.

## üìú Core Principles

Every decision in the VirtOS project is guided by these non-negotiable principles:

* **Zero-Trust, Zero-Knowledge:** The system is built on the assumption that the host environment may be hostile. User data is theirs alone and is never decrypted without their explicit action.
* **Digital Sovereignty:** The user is the sole owner and controller of their data and tools.
* **Local-First, Cloud-Optional:** All core functionality must work perfectly offline. The cloud is a user-controlled, optional enhancement, never a requirement.
* **Open Source & Auditable:** Trust is earned through transparency. The entire codebase is open for public inspection.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Account-Free & Biometric Login:** No emails, no sign-ups. Login with on-device biometrics only.
* **Total Privacy:** No telemetry, no IP tracking, and no cloud identity.
* **Hostile Environment Hardening:** Includes a custom in-app keyboard to defeat keyloggers, a screen-recording block (`FLAG_SECURE`), and a "Canary" system to detect tampering.
* **On-Device AI Workshop:** A suite of local AI tools, including language models, semantic search across your private files, and RAG.
* **Self-Contained Encrypted Vault:** All your files and data are stored in a single, encrypted container, isolated from the host OS.
* **Secure Data Transfer:** A "Secure Transfer Handshake" feature to ensure your data is not tampered with when moving it between devices.
* **Optional User-Controlled Cloud Compute:** Securely connect to your own private GPU node for running large-scale AI models.

## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap

VirtOS is an ambitious project that will be built in phases. Our current focus is on **Phase 1**.

* ‚úÖ **Phase 1: The Secure Vault** - Create the core, impenetrable offline environment.
* üîí **Phase 2: The Fortress** - Implement advanced defenses for hostile environments.
* üõ†Ô∏è **Phase 3: The AI Workshop** - Integrate powerful, private AI and productivity tools.
* üåê **Phase 4: The Citadel** - Build the modular ecosystem and optional connectivity.

For a detailed breakdown of each phase, please see our `ROADMAP.md` file.
