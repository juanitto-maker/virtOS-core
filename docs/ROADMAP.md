# VirtOS Project Roadmap

This document outlines the planned development path for VirtOS. The project is broken down into four distinct phases, each building upon the last to realize the full vision of a private AI operating system.

### Phase 1: The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) – "The Secure Vault"

**Goal:** Create the core, impenetrable offline environment.

**Key Features:**
- The VirtOS application shell with a basic virtual desktop UI.
- The Self-Contained Encrypted Vault: All data is stored in a single, encrypted container file.
- Biometric-Only Login: Authentication using on-device biometrics, requiring no account or password.
- Core Modules: A basic text editor and a secure file viewer/manager to operate on files within the vault.

**Outcome:** A user can create a highly secure, offline vault to store and edit notes and files, completely isolated from the host system's standard storage.

### Phase 2: Hostile Environment Hardening – "The Fortress"

**Goal:** Implement the advanced defenses needed to operate with reasonable safety on a potentially compromised device.

**Key Features:**
- Screenshot/Recording Block: Implement the `FLAG_SECURE` feature to make the app's content a "black box" to screen recorders and spyware.
- Embedded In-App Keyboard: A custom keyboard that is part of VirtOS itself, to bypass and defeat host OS keyloggers.
- The "Canary" System (Integrity Monitoring): VirtOS will use cryptographic hashes to check its own code and the encrypted vault file for any signs of tampering by the host OS malware. It will refuse to run or decrypt data if tampering is detected.
- Secure Transfer Handshake: A utility to generate a checksum for the vault file before transfer and a companion utility on the clean device to verify the checksum after transfer, ensuring the file was not modified in transit.

**Outcome:** VirtOS is now a hardened "digital fortress" that is extremely difficult for even sophisticated spyware to monitor, fulfilling the goal of working offline on an untrusted device.

### Phase 3: Functional Expansion – "The AI Workshop"

**Goal:** Integrate the powerful, private AI and productivity tools.

**Key Features:**
- Local LLM Integration: Add on-device language models for tasks like summarization, translation, and writing assistance.
- Local RAG & Semantic Search: Implement Retrieval-Augmented Generation to allow the AI to use documents inside the user's private vault as its knowledge base.
- Productivity Suite: Expand the modular apps to include a Markdown editor, PDF reader/summarizer, and image viewer/editor.

**Outcome:** VirtOS becomes a powerful, self-contained, and completely private AI-powered workspace.

### Phase 4: The Ecosystem & Connectivity – "The Citadel"

**Goal:** Finalize the vision of a sustainable, user-controlled platform.

**Key Features:**
- User-Controlled Cloud Compute: Implement the secure P2P tunneling (Tor, WireGuard) to allow users to connect VirtOS to their own private, rented GPU nodes for running large-scale AI models.
- Modular App Ecosystem: Build the plugin store for a
