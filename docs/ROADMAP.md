# VirtOS Project Roadmap

[span_29](start_span)This document outlines the planned development path for VirtOS.[span_29](end_span) [span_30](start_span)The project is broken down into four distinct phases, each building upon the last to realize the full vision of a private AI operating system.[span_30](end_span)

### [span_31](start_span)Phase 1: The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) – "The Secure Vault"[span_31](end_span)

**[span_32](start_span)[span_33](start_span)Goal:** Create the core, impenetrable offline environment for secure data storage and editing.[span_32](end_span)[span_33](end_span)

**Key Features:**
- **[span_34](start_span)Application Shell:** A basic virtual desktop user interface.[span_34](end_span)
- **[span_35](start_span)Encrypted Vault:** A self-contained, single-file encrypted container for all user data.[span_35](end_span)
- **[span_36](start_span)Authentication:** Account-free, biometric-only login system.[span_36](end_span)
- **[span_37](start_span)Core Modules:** A basic text editor and a secure file viewer/manager for vault contents.[span_37](end_span)

**[span_38](start_span)Outcome:** A user can create a highly secure, offline vault to protect their most sensitive notes and files.[span_38](end_span)

### [span_39](start_span)Phase 2: Hostile Environment Hardening – "The Fortress"[span_39](end_span)

**[span_40](start_span)Goal:** Implement the advanced defenses required to operate with reasonable safety on a potentially compromised device.[span_40](end_span)

**Key Features:**
- **[span_41](start_span)Screen-Recording Block:** Implement `FLAG_SECURE` to make the app's content a "black box" to spyware.[span_41](end_span)
- **[span_42](start_span)Embedded Keyboard:** A custom, in-app keyboard to bypass and defeat host OS keyloggers.[span_42](end_span)
- **[span_43](start_span)"Canary" Integrity Monitoring:** VirtOS will use cryptographic hashes to continuously check its own code and the encrypted vault for signs of tampering by the host OS.[span_43](end_span) [span_44](start_span)It will lock down if tampering is detected.[span_44](end_span)
- **[span_45](start_span)Secure Transfer Handshake:** A utility to generate and verify checksums, ensuring the vault file is not modified during transfer between devices.[span_45](end_span)

**[span_46](start_span)Outcome:** VirtOS becomes a hardened "digital fortress" designed to protect the user even in a hostile software environment.[span_46](end_span)

### [span_47](start_span)Phase 3: Functional Expansion – "The AI Workshop"[span_47](end_span)

**[span_48](start_span)Goal:** Integrate powerful, private AI and productivity tools into the secure environment.[span_48](end_span)

**Key Features:**
- **[span_49](start_span)[span_50](start_span)Local LLM Integration:** Add support for on-device language models (e.g., TinyLLaMA, Phi-2) for offline AI assistance.[span_49](end_span)[span_50](end_span)
- **[span_51](start_span)Private RAG & Semantic Search:** Implement Retrieval-Augmented Generation using only the documents within the user's private vault.[span_51](end_span)
- **[span_52](start_span)Productivity Suite:** Expand the built-in modules to include a Markdown editor, PDF reader/summarizer, and image viewer.[span_52](end_span)

**[span_53](start_span)Outcome:** VirtOS evolves into a powerful, self-contained, and completely private AI-powered workspace.[span_53](end_span)

### [span_54](start_span)Phase 4: The Ecosystem & Connectivity – "The Citadel"[span_54](end_span)

**[span_55](start_span)Goal:** Finalize the vision of a sustainable, user-controlled platform for digital sovereignty.[span_55](end_span)

**Key Features:**
- **[span_56](start_span)User-Controlled Cloud Compute:** Implement secure P2P tunneling (e.g., WireGuard, Tor) to allow users to connect VirtOS to their own rented GPU nodes for large-scale AI tasks.[span_56](end_span)
- **[span_57](start_span)Modular App Ecosystem:** Build the plugin store for a community of developers to contribute new, privacy-respecting tools.[span_57](end_span)
- **[span_58](start_span)[span_59](start_span)Privacy-Safe Business Model:** Implement the ethical business model, including a companion website for offline license generation, paid apps, and affiliate commissions for GPU rentals.[span_58](end_span)[span_59](end_span)

**[span_60](start_span)Outcome:** VirtOS becomes a complete, extensible, and sustainable platform.[span_60](end_span)
