# VirtOS Project Roadmap

This document outlines the planned development path for VirtOS. [span_0](start_span)The project is broken down into four distinct phases, each building upon the last to realize the full vision of a private AI operating system.[span_0](end_span)

---

### [span_1](start_span)Phase 1: The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) – "The Secure Vault"[span_1](end_span)

**[span_2](start_span)Goal:** Create the core, impenetrable offline environment for secure data storage and editing.[span_2](end_span)

**Key Features:**
- [span_3](start_span)The VirtOS application shell with a basic virtual desktop UI.[span_3](end_span)
- [span_4](start_span)The Self-Contained Encrypted Vault: All data is stored in a single, encrypted container file.[span_4](end_span)
- [span_5](start_span)Biometric-Only Login: Authentication using on-device biometrics, requiring no account or password.[span_5](end_span)
- [span_6](start_span)Core Modules: A basic text editor and a secure file viewer/manager for vault contents.[span_6](end_span)

**[span_7](start_span)Outcome:** A user can create a highly secure, offline vault to store and edit notes and files, completely isolated from the host system's standard storage.[span_7](end_span)

---

### [span_8](start_span)Phase 2: Hostile Environment Hardening – "The Fortress"[span_8](end_span)

**[span_9](start_span)Goal:** Implement the advanced defenses needed to operate with reasonable safety on a potentially compromised device.[span_9](end_span)

**Key Features:**
- [span_10](start_span)Screenshot/Recording Block: Implement the `FLAG_SECURE` feature to make the app's content a "black box" to screen recorders and spyware.[span_10](end_span)
- [span_11](start_span)Embedded In-App Keyboard: A custom keyboard that is part of VirtOS itself, to bypass and defeat host OS keyloggers.[span_11](end_span)
- [span_12](start_span)The "Canary" System (Integrity Monitoring): VirtOS will use cryptographic hashes to check its own code and the encrypted vault file for any signs of tampering by the host OS malware.[span_12](end_span) [span_13](start_span)It will refuse to run or decrypt data if tampering is detected.[span_13](end_span)
- [span_14](start_span)Secure Transfer Handshake: A utility to generate a checksum for the vault file before transfer and a companion utility on the clean device to verify the checksum after transfer, ensuring the file was not modified in transit.[span_14](end_span)

**[span_15](start_span)Outcome:** VirtOS becomes a hardened "digital fortress" designed to protect the user even in a hostile software environment.[span_15](end_span)

### [span_16](start_span)Phase 3: Functional Expansion – "The AI Workshop"[span_16](end_span)

**[span_17](start_span)Goal:** Integrate the powerful, private AI and productivity tools into the secure environment.[span_17](end_span)

**Key Features:**
- [span_18](start_span)Local LLM Integration: Add support for on-device language models (e.g., TinyLLaMA, Phi-2) for offline AI assistance.[span_18](end_span)
- [span_19](start_span)Private RAG & Semantic Search: Implement Retrieval-Augmented Generation using only the documents within the user's private vault.[span_19](end_span)
- [span_20](start_span)Productivity Suite: Expand the built-in modules to include a Markdown editor, PDF reader/summarizer, and image viewer.[span_20](end_span)

**[span_21](start_span)Outcome:** VirtOS evolves into a powerful, self-contained, and completely private AI-powered workspace.[span_21](end_span)

---

### [span_22](start_span)Phase 4: The Ecosystem & Connectivity – "The Citadel"[span_22](end_span)

**[span_23](start_span)Goal:** Finalize the vision of a sustainable, user-controlled platform for digital sovereignty.[span_23](end_span)

**Key Features:**
- [span_24](start_span)User-Controlled Cloud Compute: Implement secure P2P tunneling (e.g., WireGuard, Tor) to allow users to connect VirtOS to their own rented GPU nodes for large-scale AI tasks.[span_24](end_span)
- [span_25](start_span)Modular App Ecosystem: Build the plugin store for a community of developers to contribute new, privacy-respecting tools.[span_25](end_span)
- [span_26](start_span)[span_27](start_span)Privacy-Safe Business Model: Implement the ethical business model, including a companion website for offline license generation, paid apps, and affiliate commissions for GPU rentals.[span_26](end_span)[span_27](end_span)

**[span_28](start_span)Outcome:** VirtOS becomes a complete, extensible, and sustainable platform for digital sovereignty.[span_28](end_span)
