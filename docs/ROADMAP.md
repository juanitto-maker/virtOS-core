# VirtOS Project Roadmap

[span_0](start_span)[span_1](start_span)This document outlines the planned development path for VirtOS[span_0](end_span)[span_1](end_span). [span_2](start_span)The project is broken down into four distinct phases, each building upon the last to realize the full vision of a private AI operating system[span_2](end_span).

---

### [span_3](start_span)Phase 1: The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) – "The Secure Vault"[span_3](end_span)

**[span_4](start_span)Goal:** Create the core, impenetrable offline environment[span_4](end_span).

**[span_5](start_span)Key Features:**[span_5](end_span)
- [span_6](start_span)The VirtOS application shell with a basic virtual desktop UI[span_6](end_span).
- [span_7](start_span)The Self-Contained Encrypted Vault: All data is stored in a single, encrypted container file[span_7](end_span).
- [span_8](start_span)[span_9](start_span)Biometric-Only Login: Authentication using on-device biometrics, requiring no account or password[span_8](end_span)[span_9](end_span).
- [span_10](start_span)Core Modules: A basic text editor and a secure file viewer/manager to operate on files within the vault[span_10](end_span).

**[span_11](start_span)Outcome:** A user can create a highly secure, offline vault to store and edit notes and files, completely isolated from the host system's standard storage[span_11](end_span).

### [span_12](start_span)Phase 2: Hostile Environment Hardening – "The Fortress"[span_12](end_span)

**[span_13](start_span)Goal:** Implement the advanced defenses needed to operate with reasonable safety on a potentially compromised device[span_13](end_span).

**[span_14](start_span)Key Features:**[span_14](end_span)
- [span_15](start_span)Screenshot/Recording Block: Implement the `FLAG_SECURE` feature to make the app's content a "black box" to screen recorders and spyware[span_15](end_span).
- [span_16](start_span)Embedded In-App Keyboard: A custom keyboard that is part of VirtOS itself, to bypass and defeat host OS keyloggers[span_16](end_span).
- [span_17](start_span)The "Canary" System (Integrity Monitoring): VirtOS will use cryptographic hashes to check its own code and the encrypted vault file for any signs of tampering by the host OS malware[span_17](end_span). [span_18](start_span)It will refuse to run or decrypt data if tampering is detected[span_18](end_span).
- [span_19](start_span)Secure Transfer Handshake: A utility to generate a checksum for the vault file before transfer and a companion utility on the clean device to verify the checksum after transfer, ensuring the file was not modified in transit[span_19](end_span).

**[span_20](start_span)Outcome:** VirtOS is now a hardened "digital fortress" that is extremely difficult for even sophisticated spyware to monitor, fulfilling the goal of working offline on an untrusted device[span_20](end_span).

### [span_21](start_span)Phase 3: Functional Expansion – "The AI Workshop"[span_21](end_span)

**[span_22](start_span)Goal:** Integrate the powerful, private AI and productivity tools[span_22](end_span).

**[span_23](start_span)Key Features:**[span_23](end_span)
- [span_24](start_span)Local LLM Integration: Add on-device language models for tasks like summarization, translation, and writing assistance[span_24](end_span).
- [span_25](start_span)Local RAG & Semantic Search: Implement Retrieval-Augmented Generation to allow the AI to use documents inside the user's private vault as its knowledge base[span_25](end_span).
- [span_26](start_span)Productivity Suite: Expand the modular apps to include a Markdown editor, PDF reader/summarizer, and image viewer/editor[span_26](end_span).

**[span_27](start_span)Outcome:** VirtOS becomes a powerful, self-contained, and completely private AI-powered workspace[span_27](end_span).

### [span_28](start_span)Phase 4: The Ecosystem & Connectivity – "The Citadel"[span_28](end_span)

**[span_29](start_span)Goal:** Finalize the vision of a sustainable, user-controlled platform[span_29](end_span).

**[span_30](start_span)Key Features:**[span_30](end_span)
- [span_31](start_span)User-Controlled Cloud Compute: Implement the secure P2P tunneling (Tor, WireGuard) to allow users to connect VirtOS to their own private, rented GPU nodes for running large-scale AI models[span_31](end_span).
- [span_32](start_span)Modular App Ecosystem: Build the plugin store for a community of developers to add new, privacy-respecting tools[span_32](end_span).
- [span_33](start_span)Privacy-Safe Business Model: Implement the business model, including the optional paid apps and affiliate commissions for GPU rentals, ensuring the project's long-term sustainability[span_33](end_span).

**[span_34](start_span)Outcome:** VirtOS is a complete, extensible, and sustainable platform for digital sovereignty[span_34](end_span).
