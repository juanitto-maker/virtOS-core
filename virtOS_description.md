# 🧠 AIOS – The Private AI Operating System

AIOS (Artificial Intelligence Operating System) is a modular, privacy-first virtual operating environment that runs locally on your device — or optionally integrates with your own encrypted cloud compute — without requiring emails, IPs, accounts, or big tech APIs. Designed for digital autonomy, AIOS replaces cloud-tied assistants with a secure, offline-first AI workspace that feels like a full desktop OS — right in your browser or app shell.

## 🌍 Key Features

### 🔒 Privacy by Default

* **No Accounts:** Login with on-device biometrics (face or fingerprint) only.
* **No Tracking:** Zero telemetry, IP tracking, or cloud-based identity.
* **Local Storage:** All data is stored in a local, encrypted vault on your device by default.
* **Open Source:** Fully auditable on GitHub, so you don't have to trust a company, only the code.

### 🧩 Modular Ecosystem of “Apps”

VirtOS is designed to be extensible through a secure plugin system.
* Ships with default tools like a PDF reader and an image editor.
* An open developer ecosystem allows for new, privacy-respecting tools to be added.

### 💸 Business Model (Privacy-Safe)

The project is sustained without compromising user privacy.
* The core platform is free and open-source.

### 🧱 Your AI OS – Truly Yours

Unlike other "AI assistants," AIOS gives you complete control. You don’t sign up. You don’t upload your life to the cloud. You don’t trust a black box — you run your own AI system, in your own space, with your own rules. It is your portable, private, and powerful operating system.
